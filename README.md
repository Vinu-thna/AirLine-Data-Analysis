# AirLine-Data-Analysis
Air traffic delays are a significant challenge faced by the aviation industry, affecting both airlines and passengers. Delays can result from various factors such as weather conditions, air traffic congestion, technical failures, or security concerns. The ability to predict delays can assist airlines and air traffic management in minimizing these disruptions and improving the overall passenger experience.

With the foundational knowledge, I focused on historical airline data to predict delays. By leveraging machine learning models, my goal was to develop an efficient solution for forecasting flight delays. Specifically, I applied two models—Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression—to achieve this. With deeper insights into the aviation industry, I can further refine the models to enhance accuracy and create more forward-thinking solutions.

The primary objective of this project is to predict flight arrival delays using historical data with features related to flight operations and delays. The key challenges are handling missing data, choosing appropriate features, and selecting machine learning models that offer high accuracy without overfitting.

In this analysis, two machine learning models were applied to predict flight arrival delays based on historical data. The linear regression model provided a simple yet effective approach, achieving a high R² score. However, the random forest model, a more sophisticated non-linear model, demonstrated better performance, particularly on unseen test data.
